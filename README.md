- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @coendewit
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology in general and in cycling where I have special interest in getting the best out of me and my gear
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, but as technology enthusiasts are continuous learners that topic will change more often than I will update this readme
